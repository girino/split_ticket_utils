Help on class SplitTicketLogParser in module SplitTicketLogParser:

class SplitTicketLogParser
 |  Parses logs generated by https://github.com/matheusd/SplitTicketLogParser server and
 |  returns it either as a dictionary of "filename" => dict(), or as a list of dicts. Each
 |  dict contains the sections of the log files as keys and the contents as the log files
 |  as another dictionary. If the section contains subsections, each subsection is also a dictionary.
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(self, dirname)
 |      Initializes the parser with a folder name. This should point to the "sessions" folder
 |      where SplitTicketLogParser writes it's logs. The parser will swipe the folder and parse
 |      all the files in it.
 |
 |  as_dict(self)
 |      Returns the parsed files as a dictionary.
 |
 |  as_list(self)
 |      return the parsed files as a list (no filenames, only file contents).
